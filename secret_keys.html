<h1 class="chapter">Secret keys</h1>

<p>Caesar Cipher is an example of secret key cryptography. Almost half of this class will concern this sort of cryptography. In this setting, Alice and Bob won't begin sending messages until they meet in some secure setting (face-to-face, for example) to agree on a secret key. The particular secret key they choose can be used for both encryption and decryption. For this reason secret key cryptography is also called symmetric key cryptography. </p>

<h3>Goals of secret key cryptography</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The method should be secure enough that Eve would need to find the right key in order to decrypt a message between Alice and Bob. That is, Eve's only general option is to attack the keys.</li>
        <li>There should be enough possible keys that it would take Eve a "long time" to find the right key.</li>
        <li>The method itself should not need to be kept a secret. Only the key is kept secret (Kerckhoff's principle).</li>
    </ol>

<p>Does the Caesar Cipher meet these goals? Not at all.</p>

<p>Consider the first goal. Since the Caesar Cipher is susceptible to the frequency attack, Eve could crack the encryption without having to attack the keys. Since there are only 25 possible keys it's difficult to imagine a setting where the second goal is satisfied. As for the third goal we might say that the Caesar Cipher is so weak that it is equally insecure whether the method is made public or not.</p>

<p>Ultimately we will get to know the current standard in secret key cryptography, <a href='https://www.nist.gov/publications/advanced-encryption-standard-aes'> AES</a> (Advanced Encryption Standard). We will explore several other secret key cryptography systems before we get to AES. But if you want to try it out now, this <a href='https://aesencryption.net/'>website</a> let's you enter your own plain-text. But actually you use AES everyday without realizing. More on that later.</p>

<h3>Distribution of secret keys</h3>

<p>Using only secret key cryptography in order for Alice and Bob to agree on a secret key, they might have to meet face to face (or send trusted representatives). If there is some trusted third party, a large company for example, then they may be able to use already established secret key agreements to securely transmit a secret key to Alice and Bob.</p>

<p>There are billions of emails, bank transactions, and other electronic communications sent over the Internet each day. Almost all of these are important enough to require security in the form of encryption. Clearly meeting face-to-face to distribute secret keys for each of these transactions is not possible.</p>


<p>For two people to communicate securely we only need to distribute one secret key</p>

<p>A group of three people has three pairs of people. So we would need three secret keys. </p>

<p>A group of four people has six pairs of people. So we would need to distribute six secret keys for each pair to communicate securely. </p>

<p>In general, if there are n people, we will need to distribute n(n-1)/2 secret keys. So the number of keys we need grows with the square of the number of people. We need a way to securely distribute secret keys without having to meet face-to-face. In the second half of the course we will learn about public key cryptography--an elegant, almost magical solution to this problem.</p>
