<h1 class="chapter">Introduction to the frequency attack</h1>

<p>There are all sorts of amazing patterns in natural language. Some types of patterns, like specific letter frequencies are language dependent. But others, for example Zipf's Law are universal to all known natural language. </p>

<p>For example, in English, the most common letter is 'E'. That is, if you consider a piece of English text that is long enough the most common letter will almost certianly be 'E'. That being said, in 1939 Earnst Wincent Wright had the stamina and creativity to write an entire novel without using the letter 'E', Gadsby (not <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite>). But such feats are rare are natural language almost always follow patterns of letter frequency. </p>

<h4>Counting letter frequency in python.</h4>

<p>We can make a dictionary to store our counts as values for each letter. We might want to order in terms of frequency. To do this change the dictionary into a list of key, value tuples. Finally we might want to visualize the relative frequencies using a bar graph. For this we use the library matplotlib.</p>

<p>This is a characteristic of English language, the letter e happens about 13% of the time, t happens about 8% and so on. Go ahead and enter your own English text. Sufficiently long text will exhibit simmilar letter frequencies.</p>
