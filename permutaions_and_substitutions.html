<h1 class="chapter">Permutations and substitutions</h1>

<p>So far we learned two secret key cryptographic methods: Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher. Really, Caesar Cipher is just a special case of Vigenere Cipher. Each of these use substitutions. Based on a given key, and the position of the letters in plain text, we substitute them with different letters. Another way to generate cipher text is to re-arrange the letters in the plain text. Modern encryption uses both substitution and permutations (transposition).
</p>

Let's list all permutations for the word "CAT".
<ul>
<li>CAT</li>
<li>CTA</li>
<li>ACT</li>
<li>ATC</li>
<li>TCA</li>
<li>TAC</li>
</ul>
There are 6.

<p>
  The number of permutations for a word grows quickly as the number of letters increases. For example, a 6 letter word, like 'radius' has 720 possible permutations. 6 ways to choose the first letter. 5 ways to choose the second. 4 ways to choose the third letter. 3 ways to choose the forth letter. 2 ways to choose the fifth letter. 1 ways to choose the sixth letter. 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720. In general, if there are n distinct letters then there are n! distinct permutations.

  $$ n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1 $$

  0! = 1.
