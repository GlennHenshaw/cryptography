<h1 class="chapter">Introduction</h1>

<p>The goal of Cryptography is to disguise communications so that only the intended recipients can understand them. There are ancient scripts like Mayan and ancient Egyptian whose meanings were lost in history. This is not cryptography since these languages were made to foster public communication. Cryptography specifically endeavors to make communication private.</p>     

<p>Cryptography is everywhere. Every bank transfer, email, and text message is transferred through multiple computer systems. Encryption is used to keep this information private. But there is another side to this story. Hackers, law enforcement, and governments also want access to data. The story of cryptography runs parallel with the development of the Internet and exponential growth of computation power during the last 60 years.</p>  

<p>We start by discussing secret key (symmetric key) cryptography. Then we dive into public key cryptography--the technology that makes the Internet as we know it possible. Along the way we will learn some math and some computer science concepts. We will also think about some interesting philosophical and social issues. </p>

<p>From time to time you will see python cells like the one below. You can explore the code provided in these cells and you can run your own python code. Press the play button to run the code.</p>

<p>Let's consider our first secret message: 

	<pre class="text">The cash is under the mattress</pre>
   This is our <b>plain-text</b>. It's readable by anyone who happens to have an English dictionary. Our goal is to use the plain-text and some type of <b>key</b> to generate <b>cipher-text</b>. We want the cipher-text to be difficult enough to understand so that by the time a spy figures out what it says, the message will no longer be important to keep secret. This process of generating cipher-text from plain text is called <b>encryption</b>.

   <div class="center">(plain-text, key) &#8594; cipher-text</div>
</p>
<p>
   At the same time as we want to protect our message from spies, we want our intended recipient to be able to convert the cipher-text back to plain-text. We want them to be able to accomplish this much faster and easier than it would be for the spy. The process of recovering the plain-text from cipher-text is called decryption. We might hope that our intended recipient could use the same key we used for encryption to decrypt. This is a feature of <b>secret key cryprography</b>, also known as <b>symeteric key cryptography</b>.

		Secret key cryptographic methods have been in use for thousands of years. Next we will describe one supposedly used by Julius Caesar for military communications.
