<h1 class="chapter">Introduction</h1>

<p>The goal of Cryptography is to disguise communications so that only the intended recipients can understand them. There are ancient scripts like Mayan and ancient Egyptian whose meanings were lost in history. This is not cryptography since these languages were made to foster public communication. Cryptography specifically endeavors to make communication private.</p>     

<p>Cryptography is everywhere. Every bank transfer, email, and text message is transferred through multiple computer systems. Encryption is used to keep this information private. But there is another side to this story. Hackers, law enforcement, and governments also want access to data. The story of cryptography runs parallel with the development of the Internet and exponential growth of computation power during the last 60 years.</p>  

<p>We start by discussing secret key (symmetric key) cryptography. Then we dive into public key cryptography--the technology that makes the Internet as we know it possible. Along the way we will learn some math and some computer science concepts. We will also think about some interesting philosophical and social issues. </p>

<p>From time to time you will see python cells like the one below. You can explore the code provided in these cells and you can run your own python code. Press the play button to run the code.</p>
