<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>The goal of Cryptography is to disguise communications so that only the intended recipients can understand them. There are ancient scripts like Mayan and ancient Egyptian whose meanings were lost in history. This is not cryptography since these languages were made to foster public communication. Cryptography specifically endeavors to make communication private.</p>     

<p>Cryptography is everywhere. Every bank transfer, email, and text message is transferred through multiple computer systems. Encryption is used to keep this information private. But there is another side to this story. Hackers, law enforcement, and governments also want access to data. The story of cryptography is about the evolution of more and more powerful cryptographic methods due to the pressure applied by those who intercept messages and devise clever attacks to unveil encrypted messages.</p>  

<p>We start by discussing secret key (symmetric key) cryptography. Then we dive into public key cryptography--the technology that makes the internet as we know it possible. Along the way we will learn some math and some computer science concepts. We will also think about some interesting philosophical and social issues. </p>
